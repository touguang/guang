偷光

您好老师：

先给您做个自我介绍，我们是一组在欧洲学习的中国留学生。我们正在开发叫做“偷光”期刊平台。

开发“偷光” 应用程序宗旨是让我国学生、研究生和专家免费享受学术期刊。开发这款应用程序的灵感来自于我们对不同图书馆、大学的访问，这时我们才发现科学文献和仍然存在改善的空间。因为Z-文库类似的平台已被关了，而我们为我国创造了一个类似的平台对国家教育质量发展做一点贡献。

为了方便获取世界各地的科学期刊而开发了这款window及安卓应用程序。用户可以通过这款应用程序按照需求详查、检索其所需要的文件。我们将继续通过加进更多的后台文库和特点来更新“偷光”应用程序， 用户会经常接到更新通知。

若大家喜欢应用程序的话，请随时反馈，这会赋予这个工程新鲜的动力和驱动我们开发MacOS, Linux and iOS 版本。


Hello reader!!
First let us introduce ourselves. Well, we are a group of Chinese students studying in Europe. 
On visiting various libraries and universities abroad, we observed that there is still some room for improvement when it comes to scientific literature espacially when portals like Z-Library have also been shut down.
This gives us motivation to come up with an alternative developed specially for our country.
Therefore, to enable our comrades to easily access scientific journals from all countries, we have developed a Windows application and an android application.
The intent of "Tou Guang" is to make research papers easily available free of cost to students, researchers and professionals of our country.
These applications are developed to crawl online portals for such files and retrieve them on demand.
We are continually trying to upgrade our application by adding more libraries and features for which we will be pushing updates from time to time.
Please feel free to share your valuable feedback with us. If the response is good, we will add more libraries at backend and will develop applications for MacOS, Linux and iOS devices also.
